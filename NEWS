0.5.0 - 2009-01-20
------------------

1. The configuration files (/etc/amazonrc and typically ~/.amazonrc) are now
   locale-specific. Global and locale-specific settings can now be placed in
   their own sections. For example:

   Old style .amazonrc:
   
     associate = 'caliban-21'
     locale = 'uk'
     cache = false
     key_id = '0Y44V8FAFNM119C6XYZ2'
   
   New style .amazonrc:
   
     [global]
     locale = 'uk'
     cache = false
     key_id = '0Y44V8FAFNM119C6XYZ2'
     
     [uk]
     associate = 'calibanorg-21'
     
     [us]
     associate = 'calibanorg-20'
   
   
   The old style of configuration is still supported.

2. ItemLookup.new and SellerListingLookup.new no longer take a third
   parameter, b_parameters. Instead, the new Operation#batch method can be
   used to create batch operations.

   Operation#batch can batch multiple operations of any class, not just
   ItemLookup and SellerListingLookup. The only requirement if that all
   batched operations must be of the same class.

   If you want to send multiple operations of different classes as a single
   request, you must still use the MultipleOperation class.

3. VehiclePartLookup, VehiclePartSearch and VehicleSearch operations (which
   were added in the 2008-08-19 revision of the AWS API, are now supported.
   However, VehiclePartLookup is the only one of these that currently supports
   pagination.

4. The list of allowable search indices for ItemSearch operations has been
   updated in accordance with the latest AWS documentation.

5. Parameter checking for ItemSearch operations no longer occurs. It was
   impractical to keep the list of valid parameters concurrent with AWS.
   Related constants have therefore also been removed.

6. The version of the AWS API used is now 2009-01-06, the latest at the time
   of writing.

   The configuration file now supports a new global parameter for requesting a
   different version of the API. For example:

     api = '2008-08-19'

7. While testing the ability to request a specific version of the AWS API, I
   encountered a new kind of AWS error, the internal error, which is reported
   using a different XML construct to that used for all other error
   conditions.

   I triggered one of these internal errors when I attempted an operation, a
   VehicleSearch, that did not yet exist in the older version of the API that
   I requested.

   This type of error now throws a generic Amazon::AWS::Error::AWSError
   exception.
   
   It's reasonable to assume that there are other conditions that would cause
   an internal AWS error to occur. These, too, will be raised as an exception.
   
   Unfortunately, AWS supplies no information on the cause of such internal
   errors, so Ruby/AWS is unable to pass on any clues to the user.


0.4.4 - 2008-10-03
------------------

1. It's now possible to have Ruby/AWS use a user configuration file with a
   name other than .amazonrc. This is achieved by defining $AMAZONRCFILE. If
   left undefined, the default of .amazonrc is used.

2. Locations other than $HOME were not being checked for .amazonrc. This bug
   has now been fixed.


0.4.3 - 2008-09-22
------------------

1. $AMAZONRCDIR is now searched for .amazonrc before $HOME and the other
   directories. This allows a user-defined location to be used for the user
   configuration file.

2. There is a new top-level class of exception for Ruby/AWS,
   Amazon::AmazonError.

   Most non-operational exceptions, such as Amazon::AWS::HTTPError,
   Amazon::Config::ConfigError,
   Amazon::AWS::Search::Request::AccessKeyIdError,
   Amazon::AWS::Search::Request::LocaleError and
   Amazon::AWS::ShoppingCart::CartError are now immediate subclasses of
   AmazonError. Previously, they were subclasses of StandardError.

3. Amazon::AWS::Error::AWSError was previously a class that generated
   exceptions, but it's now simply a container class derived from AmazonError.
   All operational exceptions -- the ones whose class is dynamically created
   when AWS returns an error -- are now subclasses of AWSError. Previously,
   they were immediate subclasses of StandardError.

   This has the advantage of allowing all of the exceptions resulting from
   operational errors to be caught by rescuing just the container class,
   AWSError.
       

0.4.2 - 2008-09-11
------------------

1. The version of the Amazon AWS API requested when performing operations is
   now 2008-08-19. This is the latest at the time of writing.

2. The exception class Amazon::Config::ConfigError was mysteriously not
   defined.

3. Amazon::Config.new now accepts an optional argument, config_str, which may
   contain the string equivalent of a config file's contents. When config_str
   is not nil (nil is the default), this string is read instead of
   /etc/amazonrc and ~/.amazonrc. This addition is really just to aid
   unit-testing of the Amazon::Config class, as Amazon::Config.new never needs
   to be called by user code.

4. Config file lines may now contain leading whitespace.

5. The Amazon::AWS::MAX_PAGES constant has gone, replaced by the PAGINATION
   hash. Only ItemSearch should use ItemPage to page through results up to
   MAX_PAGES when ALL_PAGES has been requested, but the same approach was
   attempted for all types of operation.
     
   Each operation has its own pagination parameter and its own maximum number
   of pages that can be fetched. This is now stored in the
   Amazon::AWS::PAGINATION hash.
        
   Note that ItemLookup has three possible pagination parameters: OfferPage,
   VariationPage and ReviewPage. Ruby/AWS uses OfferPage for the purposes of
   ALL_PAGES.
	   
   Operations that do not explicitly provide a pagination parameter (or, at
   least, those for which there isn't one listed in the AWS Developer's Guide)
   use ItemPage for pagination up to page 400. In practice, this is likely to
   throw an exception, as such operations almost certainly don't support
   multiple results pages.


0.4.1 - 2008-08-18
------------------

1. The exception class Amazon::AWS::HTTPError was not actually defined, which
   caused an error when an attempt was made to raise an instance of it.

2. If you're using Windows, %HOME% typically isn't defined. Therefore, the
   following sequence of paths is now searched for your .amazonrc
   configuration file:

     %HOME%
     %HOMEDRIVE% + %HOMEPATH%
     %USERPROFILE%
     
   Choose one of these at your convenience.

3. The Ruby/AWS gem has been renamed ruby-aaws (from ruby-aws) to avoid a
   namespace clash with another project. This clash prevented remote
   installation of the gem.


0.4.0 - 2008-07-05
------------------

1. The version of the Amazon AWS API requested when performing operations is
   now 2008-06-26. This is the latest at the time of writing.

2. A new method, Amazon::AWS::ShoppingCart::Cart#cart_get, has been added, to
   allow the retrieval of an existing shopping-cart from AWS. This is
   necessary when the original Cart object no longer exists.

3. A bug in Amazon::AWS::ShoppingCart::Cart#cart_modify has been fixed, which
   caused carts with no items in their active section to raise an exception.


0.3.3 - 2008-06-23
------------------

1. YAML.aws_load has been removed. Its functionality is available directly
   from Amazon::AWS::AWSObject.yaml_load and it wasn't logical or necessary to
   duplicate that in the YAML class itself. There was no corresponding
   Marshal.aws_load method, but if there had been, that, too, would have been
   removed.

2. Ruby/AWS is finally available as a RubyGems package and can be found here:

     http://www.caliban.org/files/ruby/ruby-aws-0.3.3.gem

   The enclosed Rakefile can be used to build the gem from scratch. First make
   sure you have rake and rubygems installed, and then simply type 'rake' in
   the top level directory of the archive. The gem will be generated and
   placed in the ./pkg subdirectory, from where you can 'sudo gem install' it.

   This is my first gem, so bear with me. It appears to work properly, but I
   offer no guarantees. One thing that doesn't currently work is installing
   the package with gem's -t option to run the supplied unit tests.

   More information about RubyGems can be found here:

     http://www.rubygems.org/


0.3.2 - 2008-06-17
------------------

1. Serialisation, e.g. with Marshal and YAML, has been a problem until now.
  
   This is because subclasses of Amazon::AWS::AWSObject are created as needed
   when XML responses from AWS are parsed. Whilst there is no problem dumping
   objects instantiated from such classes, the difficulty arises when later
   loading and attempting to reinstantiate them in a new process, because the
   dynamic classes from which they were spawned no longer exist.

   The solution to the problem comes in the form of the new methods
   Amazon::AWS::AWSObject.load and Amazon::AWS::AWSObject.yaml_load. Use these
   as alternatives to Marshal.load and YAML.load, respectively.


0.3.1 - 2008-06-10
------------------

This release mostly features refinements to the support for remote
shopping-carts.

1. The 'Save For Later' area of remote shopping-carts is now implemented.

   Cart#cart_modify now takes an extra parameter, save_for_later. If true,
   items are moved from the active to the Save For Later area of the cart. If
   false, they are moved in the opposite direction.

   In both cases, the quantity parameter is ignored, because attempting to
   pass it through to AWS results in an error, even though the AWS
   documentation claims this can be done to move partial quantities from one
   area of the cart to the other.

2. Cart objects now have a @saved_for_later_items attribute, aliased to
   @saved_items and @saved for brevity. Take your pick.

3. @cart_items is now set to [] when Cart.new is called. Previously, it wasn't
   set until Cart#cart_create was used, at which time it was set to nil.
   @saved_for_later_items is also set to [] by Cart.new.

4. Cart#include? now also returns true if the item being queried is in the
   Save For Later area of the cart. Previously, only the active area was
   inspected.

5. New methods, Cart#active? and Cart#saved_for_later? (alias Cart#saved?),
   return whether or not an item is present in a particular area of the cart.
   If the item is present, its CartItemId is returned; otherwise 'false'.

6. A bug that caused shopping-cart transactions to use the cache if one was
   requested has been fixed. Shopping-carts should never use the cache under
   any circumstances.

7. Request objects can now have their @cache attribute assigned to. A Cache
   object may be directly assigned to it, or you may assign the value 'true'.
   If @cache is set to 'true', a Cache object will automatically be assigned
   to it the next time @cache is referenced. This is most useful when one
   wishes to switch from using no cache to using one, or vice versa.

8. Cache#flush_expired invariably threw an exception. This bug has been fixed.

9. Geolocation of users by host and IP address now raises an
   Amazon::Locale::GeoError exception if the host or IP address is
   unresolvable.

There's a new Ruby/AWS mailing-list for discussion of the development and
usage of this library:

  http://www.caliban.org/mailman/listinfo/ruby-aws


0.3.0 - 2008-05-19
------------------

1. The version of the Amazon AWS API requested when performing operations is
   now 2008-04-07. This is the latest at the time of writing.

2. Remote shopping-carts are now implemented. See the
   Amazon::AWS::ShoppingCart module and the Amazon::AWS::ShoppingCart::Cart
   class in ./amazon/aws/shoppingcart.rb for more details.

   Basically, the new methods are Cart.new, Cart#cart_create, Cart#cart_add,
   Cart#cart_modify and Cart#cart_clear. There's also Cart#each for iterating
   over the items in a cart.

   This adds the following AWS operations to the list of those supported:

     CartCreate
     CartAdd
     CartModify
     CartClear

   It's currently not possible to update a wishlist at purchase time by
   referring to the item's ListItemId when adding it to a cart.

   It's also currently not possible to add items to the 'Saved For Later'
   section of the cart.

3. A new iterator method, AWSObject#each, yields each |property, value| of the
   AWSObject.

4. The AWSObject and AWSArray classes have received a few new helper methods
   that should make AWSObject and single element AWSArray objects behave more
   akin to strings when they are being compared with strings, matched against
   regexes, etc.

5. An otherwise undocumented method, AWSObject#kernel, provides unnested (i.e.
   top level) AWSObject objects with a shortcut reference to the data most
   likely of interest to the user.

   For example, if a top level AWSObject is formed as the result of an
   ItemSearch, one might normally refer to the items returned with something
   like this:

     foo.item_search_response[0].items[0].item

   AWSObject#kernel allows the same data to be referred to as follows:

     foo.kernel

   The path to the data is programatically determined, so this method only
   works for top level AWSObject objects created by a class of operation whose
   name can be used to derive the path. This is why this method is not
   mentioned in the RDoc documentation.

6. When searches are performed, greater efforts are now made to determine
   whether Amazon returned any errors. In particular, batch operations and
   MultipleOperations may return errors at different locations in the XML tree
   than normal operations.

7. A bug that materialised only when using an HTTP proxy has been fixed.


0.2.0 - 2008-04-28
------------------

1. In previous versions, only 5 types of operation were supported:
   
     BrowseNodeLookup
     ItemLookup
     ItemSearch
     ListSearch
     SellerListingSearch
   
   This version supports all remaining non-shopping-cart operations:
   
     CustomerContentLookup
     CustomerContentSearch
     Help
     ListLookup
     SellerListingSearch
     SellerLookup
     SimilarityLookup
     TagLookup
     TransactionLookup
   
   Examples of each of these can be found in ./examples/
   
   It is hoped that shopping-carts will make their debut in the next release
   of Ruby/AWS.

2. One can now use a Symbol for search indices and hash keys when
   instantiating operation objects and response group objects.

   For example:

     is = ItemSearch.new( 'Books', { 'Title' => 'Ruby' } )
     rg = ResponseGroup.new( 'Large' )

   can now be written like this:

     is = ItemSearch.new( :Books, { :Title => 'Ruby' } )
     rg = ResponseGroup.new( :Large )

   It's up to you which form you use. The Symbol form saves one character. :-)

3. AWSObject#to_s has been improved to provide something better looking.
   There's still room for improvement, though.

4. AWSObject#to_i has been added. This allows, for example, AWSObjects to be
   used with the %d format specifier in formatted strings. It's up to you,
   though, to know when an AWSObject can be expected to contain a String
   that's usable as an Integer.

5. Objects of a class whose name matches AWSObject::.*Image typically have a
   @url attribute that points to the URL of the image in question. Such
   objects now have a #get method, which can be used to retrieve the image in
   question. This method takes a single parameter, an integer precentage,
   which causes the retrieved image to be overlayed with a discount icon.

6. Various compatibility fixes were made to allow Ruby/AWS to work under Ruby
   1.9. The use of Ruby/AWS with this version is still not recommended,
   however. For one thing, Ruby 1.9 seems to use #inspect in places that Ruby
   1.8 used #to_s.


0.1.0 - 2008-04-11
------------------

1. Version 0.1.0 of Ruby/AWS has undergone fundamental changes from the
   previous, very crude versions, 0.0.1 and 0.0.2.

   For one thing, the AWS XML parser has been completely rewritten. In this
   new version, classes are dynamically generated as required, based on the
   elements present in the XML pages returned by AWS.

   Previous versions of Ruby/AWS (and also Ruby/Amazon), manually defined most
   of these classes, based on Amazon's developer documentation and examination
   of AWS XML reponses. This time-consuming, unwieldy and unnecessary approach
   was largely the result of my own lack of aptitude with the Ruby REXML
   library.

   While these manually defined classes accounted for much of the data
   returned by AWS, a smaller section of the data was, nevertheless,
   dynamically converted to Ruby data structures. This mix of manually and
   automatically treated objects led to inconsistencies in the Ruby
   representation of the hierarchical XML structure. This meant that it was
   not quite possible to look at an AWS XML response and reliably determine
   how the resulting Ruby data structure would look.

   That inconsistency has been ironed out in version 0.1.0. As of now,
   _everything_ is dynamically generated from the AWS XML response. All manual
   class definitions have been removed and all classes are now defined at the
   time they first need to be instantiated.

   This has the following advantages:

     - Changes in the structure of AWS XML responses will not break Ruby/AWS.
       They may break user code (if, for example, you depend on the presence
       of a piece of data that later disappears from AWS responses [and even
       this should not happen, because AWS v4 has a versioned API]), but they
       will not break the library. The library will always create whichever
       classes are needed to represent any given XML structure returned by
       AWS.

     - Changes in the structure of AWS XML that results in new data being
       included in responses will automatically cause said data to be made
       available via Ruby/AWS. If, for example, Amazon starts to return data
       about the duration of each CD in their catalogue, perhaps using a
       <Duration> tag, foo.duration would automatically start to return that
       property.

     - It should be faster, but I haven't verified this.

2. Multiple operations are now supported.

3. Geolocation of locale is now working.

4. Documentation in this version has been radically improved, but is still
   lacking.
